NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

stty: Standardeingabe: Unpassender IOCTL (I/O-Control) für das Gerät
Enter current password for root (enter for none):
stty: Standardeingabe: Unpassender IOCTL (I/O-Control) für das Gerät
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

You already have a root password set, so you can safely answer 'n'.

Change the root password? [Y/n] stty: Standardeingabe: Unpassender IOCTL (I/O-Control) für das Gerät
New password:
Re-enter new password:
stty: Standardeingabe: Unpassender IOCTL (I/O-Control) für das Gerät
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MariaDB installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MariaDB without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]  ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]  ... Success!

By default, MariaDB comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]  - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]  ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MariaDB
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MariaDB!

Done.

First: Visit https://192.168.0.213/  https://nextcloudpi.local/ (also https://nextcloudpi.lan/ or https://nextcloudpi/ on windows and mac)
to activate your instance of NC, and save the auto generated passwords. You may review or reset them
anytime by using nc-admin and nc-passwd.
Second: Type 'sudo ncp-config' to further configure NCP, or access ncp-web on https://192.168.0.213:4443/
Note: You will have to add an exception, to bypass your browser warning when you
first load the activation and :4443 pages. You can run letsencrypt to get rid of
the warning if you have a (sub)domain available.
